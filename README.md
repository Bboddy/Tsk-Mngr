# sinatra-task-manager
 Website for users to login and create task and trak them to completion
###My Sinatra Project###
 This app allows for people to create update/edit and delete tasks. Each user will need to create an account with every username having to be uniqe. They can then only interact with their tasks that belong to their user and do what every they see fit.
###Installation###
 Go to https://github.com/Bboddy/Tsk-Mngr Download as a zip and extract it to where you want to keep it. Once extracted open terminal and navigate to the directory of where you stored it. Once in the Tsk-Mngr directory run "bundle install", this will download all the prerequisites. Once complete you can host the website by typing shotgun into the terminal, and navigating to the adress that it gives you. (Something like this http://127.0.0.1:9393/)
